  "content": "\nWaitangi Day reminds us of our two nations’ long, deep, and enduring friendship. The first U.S. Consul to New Zealand, James Reddy Clendon, was there to witness Te Tiriti o Waitangi in February 1840.\n\n\nOne hundred eighty years since the first U.S. Consul to Aotearoa was appointed, the United States and New Zealand remain steadfast partners. We appreciate New Zealand’s renewed pledge to bolster security and prosperity in the region through the Pacific Reset policy. This past year, we increased cooperation between our two countries in securing a free and open Indo-Pacific that remains part of the rules-based order. We value our warm relationship with New Zealand and look forward to working together to accomplish even more in the years ahead. I wish all New Zealanders well as you commemorate this Waitangi Day at home and around the world.\n\n",
