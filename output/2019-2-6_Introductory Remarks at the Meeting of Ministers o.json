It’s great to see you again. You’ve heard from me plenty already today, so it’s someone else’s turn to get a chance to speak with you, a very important person. The Commander-in-Chief and I have a strong working relationship when it comes to fighting terrorism and conducting all other aspects of America’s foreign policy, and one thing I must say I love about the President’s approach to ISIS is that he doesn’t downplay the threat. He’s not comparing the threat from Islamist terror to falls in bathtubs or to gun violence. He knows it’s a fundamentally different threat in nature and in kind. Another thing I like is that President Trump doesn’t waste any time, and he won’t waste yours today either. He has said from the moment he first took office that he was alarmed and appalled at how very dominant ISIS was, now two years ago. So he directed us, and he rolled up his sleeves. We got to work changing that map, dismantling the so-called caliphate, shrinking its influence and liberating innocents from the terror group’s savagery and slavery.\n\n\nThanks to his leadership, our armed forces, our allies in the Global Coalition, and local partners, the map has changed over the last two years, and ISIS is now the one that’s seeing red. President Trump said last night in his message to the nation, in the State of the Union, that ISIS’s territorial caliphate is virtually defeated. He has also made clear that we’re ready to come back in full force if ISIS reorganizes and reemerges.\n\n\nYou’ll get to hear more from him now. Without further ado, please join me in welcoming the President of the United States, President Donald Trump.\n\n",
