  "content": "\nWe welcome the news that the UN and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) are making a second humanitarian aid delivery from Damascus to the Rukban encampment, providing critical food, medical care, warm clothes, and shelter materials. This follows the successful delivery that took place in November 2018. We recognize the courageous efforts of the UN and SARC humanitarian workers who are carrying out this delivery, and we thank the UN for its tireless advocacy to ensure that life-saving aid reaches Syrians in desperate need.\n\n\nWe look forward to a more regular and sustained process for delivering urgently-needed humanitarian assistance from Damascus to Rukban as we work with our partners to find a sustainable solution for the tens of thousands of displaced people at the encampment, the majority of whom are women and children. We continue to call for sustained rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to the people in Rukban and all vulnerable people throughout Syria in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2449.\n\n\nThe United States is the largest single donor for the Syria response, providing more than $9.1 billion in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the conflict inside Syria and throughout the region since the start of the crisis. We remain committed to getting life-saving support to all Syrian civilians affected by conflict.\n\n",
